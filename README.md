# JS_Projects

Live page: https://codegreg1.github.io/JS_Projects/

The reason I have chosen to put all my learning projects on here is for reference for myself if I ever need to dip into the code to remind myself of something learnt from the 50 days of Javascript course I followed on Udemy. I would recommend Brad Traversy tutorials as he really explains well what is going on. 
I'm much more confident with Javascript now I've gone through this course and will definitely jump into others in the future!
